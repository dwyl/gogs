# _Why?_ üí°

We needed an _easy_ way to interact 
with our **`Gogs`** (GitHub Backup) **Server**
from our **`Elixir/Phoenix`** App.
This package is that interface. 

> **Note**: We were _briefly_ tempted 
> to write this code _inside_ the Phoenix App 
> that uses it, 
> however we quickly realized
> that having it ***separate*** was better
> for ***testability/maintainability***.
> Having a _separate_ module enforces a
> [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)
> with a strong "API contract".
> This way we know this package is well-tested,
> documented and maintained. 
> And can be used and _extended independently_ 
> of any `Elixir/Phoenix` app.
> The `Elixir/Phoenix` app can treat `gogs`
> as a logically separate/independent entity
> with a clear interface.

# _What_? üì¶

A library for interacting with `gogs` (`git`)
from `Elixir` apps. <br />

Hopefully this diagram explains 
how we use the package:

<div align="center">

![Phoenix-Gogs-Infra-dagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/167098379-e06ee8ae-d652-4464-83d7-e209d442e9e2.png)

</div>

For the complete list of functions,
please see the docs: https://hexdocs.pm/gogs üìö 

# Who? üë§ 

This library is used by our (`Phoenix`) GitHub Backup App. <br />
If you find it helpful for your project,
please ‚≠ê on GitHub: 
[github.com/dwyl/gogs](https://github.com/dwyl/gogs)


## _How_? üíª

There are a couple of steps to get this working in your project.
It should only take **`2 mins`** if you already have your
**`Gogs` Server** _deployed_ (_or access to an existing instance_).


> If you want to read a **step-by-step complete beginner's guide**
> to getting **`gogs`** working in a **`Phoenix`** App,
> please see: 
> [github.com/dwyl/**gogs-demo**](https://github.com/dwyl/gogs-demo)


<br />

## Install ‚¨áÔ∏è

Install the package from [hex.pm](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), 
by adding `gogs` to the list of dependencies in your `mix.exs` file:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:gogs, "~> 1.0.2"}
  ]
end
```

Once you've saved the `mix.exs` file, 
run: 
```sh
mix deps.get
```

<br />

## Config ‚öôÔ∏è

If you are writing tests for a function that relies on `gogs` (and you should!)
then you can add the following line to your `config/test.exs` file:

```sh
config :gogs, mock: true
```
e.g: [config/test.exs#L2-L4](https://github.com/dwyl/gogs/blob/f6d4658ae2a993aac3a76e812e915680964dfdb5/config/test.exs#L2-L4)


<br />

## _Setup_ üîß

For `gogs` to work
in your `Elixir/Phoenix` App,
you will need to have 
a few environment variables defined.

There are **3 _required_** 
and **2 _optional_** variables.
Make sure you read through the next section
to determine if you _need_ the _optional_ ones.


### _Required_ Environment Variables

> See: [`.env_sample`](https://github.com/dwyl/gogs/blob/main/.env_sample)

There are **3 _required_** environment variables:

1. `GOGS_URL` - the domain where your Gogs Server is deployed,
   without the protocol, e.g: `gogs-server.fly.dev`

2. `GOGS_ACCESS_TOKEN` - the REST API Access Token 
See: https://github.com/dwyl/gogs-server#connect-via-rest-api-https

3. `GOGS_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` - absolute path to the `id_rsa` file
  on your `localhost` or `Phoenix` server instance.

> @SIMON: this last env var currently not being picked up.
> So it will just use `~/simon/id_rsa` 
> You will need to add your `public` key 
> to the Gogs instance for this to work on your `localhost`
> see:
> https://github.com/dwyl/gogs-server#add-ssh-key


### _Optional_ Environment Variables

#### `GOGS_SSH_PORT`

If your **`Gogs` Server** is configured 
with a **_non-standard_ SSH port**, 
then you need to define it:
**`GOGS_SSH_PORT`** <br />
e.g: `10022` for our 
`Gogs` Server deployed to Fly.io

You can easily discover the port by either visiting your
Gogs Server Config page: <br />
`https://your-gogs-server.net/admin/config`

e.g:
https://gogs-server.fly.dev/admin/config

<!-- Move these screenshots to the gogs-server repo ssh section? -->

![gogs-ssh-port-config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/167105374-ef36752f-80a7-4a77-8c78-2dda44a132f9.png)

Or if you don't have admin access to the config page,
simply view the `ssh` clone link on a repo page,
e.g: https://gogs-server.fly.dev/nelsonic/public-repo

![gogs-ssh-port-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/167104890-31b06fa0-bd23-4ecb-b680-91c92398b0a7.png)

In our case the `GOGS_SSH_PORT` e.g: `10022`. <br />
If you don't set it, then `gogs` will assume TCP port **`22`**.

#### `GIT_TEMP_DIR_PATH`

If you want to specify a directory where 
you want to clone `git` repos to,
create a `GIT_TEMP_DIR_PATH` environment variable.
e.g:

```sh
export GIT_TEMP_DIR_PATH=tmp
```

> **Note**: the directory **must _already_ exist**.
> (it won't be created if it's not there ...)

<br />

## Usage

If you just want to _read_ 
the contents of a file hosted on
a `Gogs` Server,
write code similar to this:

```elixir
org_name = "myorg"
repo_name = "public-repo"
file_name = "README.md"
{:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{ body: response_body}} = 
  Gogs.remote_read_raw(org_name, repo_name,file_name)
# use the response_body (plaintext data)
```

This is exactly the use-case presented in our demo app:
[dwyl/**gogs-demo**#4-create-function](https://github.com/dwyl/gogs-demo#4-create-function-to-interact-with-gogs-repo)



<br />

Here's a more real-world scenario 
in 7 easy steps:

### 1. _Create_ a New Repo on the Gogs Server

```elixir
# Define the params for the remote repository:
org_name = "myorg"
repo_name = "repo-name"
private = false # boolean
# Create the repo!
Gogs.remote_repo_create(org_name, repo_name, private)
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: there is currently no way 
> to create an Organisation on the `Gogs` Server
> via `REST API` so the `org_name` 
> _must_ already exists. 
> e.g: https://gogs-server.fly.dev/myorg
> We will be figuring out a workaround shortly ...
> https://github.com/dwyl/gogs/issues/17


### 2. _Clone_ the Repo

```elixir
git_repo_url = Gogs.Helpers.remote_url_ssh(org_name, repo_name)
Gogs.clone(git_repo_url)
```

> Provided you have setup the environment variables,
> and your `Elixir/Phoenix` App has write access to the filesystem,
> this should work without any issues.
> We haven't seen any in practice. 
> But if you get stuck at this step,
> [open an issue](https://github.com/dwyl/gogs/issues)

### 3. _Read_ the Contents of _Local_ (Cloned) File

Once you've cloned the `Git` Repo from the `Gogs` Server
to the local filesystem of the `Elixir/Phoenix` App,
you can read any file inside it.

```elixir
org_name = "myorg"
repo_name = "public-repo"
file_name = "README.md"
{:ok, text} == Gogs.local_file_read(org_name, repo_name, file_name)
```

### 4. _Write_ to a File

```elixir
file_name = "README.md"
text = "Your README.md text"
Gogs.local_file_write_text(org_name, repo_name, file_name, text)
```

This will create a new file if it doesn't already exist.

### 5. _Commit_ Changes

```elixir
{:ok, msg} = Gogs.commit(org_name, repo_name, 
  %{message: "your commit message", full_name: "Al Ex", email: "alex@dwyl.co"})
```

### 6. _Push_ to `Gogs` Remote

```elixir    
#¬†Push to Gogs Server this one is easy.
Gogs.push(org_name, repo_name)
```

### 7. _Confirm_ the File was Update on the Remote repo

```elixir
# Confirm the README.md was updated on the remote repo:
{:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{ body: response_body}} = 
    Gogs.remote_read_raw(org_name, repo_name, file_name)
"Your README.md text"
```


## Full Function Reference / Docs? üìñ 

Rather than duplicate all the docs here, 
please read the complete function reference, 
on hexdocs: https://hexdocs.pm/gogs/Gogs.html

<br />

## Tests! 

By default, the tests run with "mocks",
this means that: <br />
1. Functional tests run faster (0.2 seconds)
2. Tests that require filesystem access will run on GitHub CI.
3. We know that functions are appropriately 
  ["Test Doubled"]
  so that a downstream `Elixir/Phoenix` app 
  can run in `mock: true` and tests will be mocked (and thus _fast_!)

To alter this setting to run the tests _without_ mocks,
simply change the boolean from:

```elixir
config :gogs, mock: true
```

To:

```elixir
config :gogs, mock: false
```

You should still see the same output as all the functions should be tested.

### Test Coverage

When you run the command:

```sh
mix c
```
(an alias for `mix coveralls.html`) <br />
You will see output similar to the following:

```sh
Finished in 0.1 seconds (0.1s async, 0.00s sync)
3 doctests, 27 tests, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 715101
----------------
COV    FILE                                        LINES RELEVANT   MISSED
100.0% lib/git_mock.ex                                55        7        0
100.0% lib/gogs.ex                                   212       41        0

[TOTAL] 100.0%
----------------
```

If you want to run the tests _without_ mocks (i.e. "end-to-end"),
update the line in `config/test.exs`:

```sh
config :gogs, mock: false
```
When you run end-to-end tests with coverage tracking: 

```sh
mix c
```

You should see the same output:

```sh
Finished in 5.5 seconds (5.5s async, 0.00s sync)
3 doctests, 27 tests, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 388372
----------------
COV    FILE                                        LINES RELEVANT   MISSED
100.0% lib/git_mock.ex                                55        7        0
100.0% lib/gogs.ex                                   212       41        0
100.0% lib/helpers.ex                                131       17        0
100.0% lib/http.ex                                   119       18        0
100.0% lib/httpoison_mock.ex                         124       20        0
[TOTAL] 100.0%
----------------
```

The only difference is the ***time*** it takes to run the test suite. <br />
The outcome (all tests passing and **100% coverage**) should be ***identical***.

If you add a feature to the package, 
please ensure that the tests pass 
in both `mock: true` and `mock: false`
so that we know it works in the _real_ world 
as well as in the simulated one. 

<br />

## Roadmap

We are aiming to do a 1:1 feature map between GitHub and `Gogs`
so that we can backup our entire organisation, all repos, issues, labels & PRs.

We aren't there yet
and we might not be for some time.
The order in which we will be working 
on fleshing out the features is:

1. **Git Diff** - using the `Git` module to determine the changes made to a specific file
  between two Git commits/hashes. This will allow us to visualize the changes made
  and can therefore _derive_ the contents of a Pull Request 
  without having the PR feature exposed via the Gogs API.
  See: https://github.com/dwyl/gogs/issues/27
2. **Issues**: https://github.com/gogs/docs-api/tree/master/Issues
  + **Comments** - this is the core content of issues. 
    We need to parse all the data and map it to the fields in `Gogs`.
  + **Labels** - the primary metadata we use to categorize our issues, 
    see: https://github.com/dwyl/labels
  + **Milestones** - used to _group_ issues into batches, e.g. a "sprint" or "feature".
3. **Repo Stats**: Stars, watchers, forks etc.
4. **_Your_ Feature Request** Here! 
Seriously, if you spot a gap in the list of available functions, 
something you want/need to use `Gogs` in any a more advanced/custom way,
please open an issue so we can discuss!
