## Why?

We needed a way of _easily_ to interact 
with our **`Gogs`** (GitHub Backup) **Server**
from our **`Elixir`** / **`Phoenix`** Applications.
This package is that interface. 

## What?

Very much still work-in-progress. ‚è≥  üë®‚Äçüíª  <br />
But we already have a handful of functions working.  üöÄ<br />
See: https://hexdocs.pm/gogs/Gogs.html üìö 

## Who?

For now this is "for us by us".
But we already have a potential reuse case for this. 

## _How_?

## Installation

Install the package from [hex.pm](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), 
the package can be installed
by adding `gogs` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:gogs, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Complete function reference, see: https://hexdocs.pm/gogs/Gogs.html

## Function Roadmap

+ [ ] Connect to Git Endpoint - perhaps a proxy for this is having access to a know repository.
+ [ ] Create or `Org` this might only be done via the API.
