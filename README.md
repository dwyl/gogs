# _Why?_ üí°

We needed an _easy_ way to interact 
with our **`Gogs`** (GitHub Backup) **Server**
from our **`Elixir/Phoenix`** App.
This package is that interface. 

> **Note**: We were _briefly_ tempted 
> to write this code _inside_ the Phoenix App 
> that uses it, 
> however we quickly realized
> that having it ***separate*** was better
> for ***testability/maintainability***.
> Having a _separate_ module enforces a
> [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)
> with a strong "API contract".
> This way we know this package is well-tested,
> documented and maintained. 
> And can be used and _extended independently_ 
> of any `Elixir/Phoenix` app.
> The `Elixir/Phoenix` app can treat `gogs`
> as a logically separate/independent entity
> with a clear interface.

# _What_? üì¶

A library for interacting with `gogs` (`git`)
from our `Elixir` apps. <br />

Hopefully this diagram explains 
how we are using the package:

<div align="center">

![Phoenix-Gogs-Infra-dagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/167098379-e06ee8ae-d652-4464-83d7-e209d442e9e2.png)

</div>

For the complete list of functions,
please see the docs: https://hexdocs.pm/gogs üìö 

# Who? üë§

This library is used by our (`Phoenix`) GitHub Backup App. <br />
If you find it helpful for your project,
please ‚≠ê on GitHub: 
[github.com/dwyl/gogs](https://github.com/dwyl/gogs)


## _How_? üíª

There are a couple of steps to get this working in your project.

<br />

## Install ‚¨áÔ∏è

Install the package from [hex.pm](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), 
by adding `gogs` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:gogs, "~> 0.7.0"}
  ]
end
```

Once you've saved your `mix.exs` file, 
run: 
```sh
mix deps.get
```

<br />

## _Setup_ üîß

For `gogs` to work
in your `Elixir/Phoenix` App,
you will need to have 
a few environment variables defined.


### _Required_ Environment Variables

> See: [`.env_sample`](https://github.com/dwyl/gogs/blob/main/.env_sample)

There are **3 _required_** environment variables:

1. `GOGS_URL` - the domain where your Gogs Server is deployed,
   without the protocol, e.g: `gogs-server.fly.dev`

2. `GOGS_ACCESS_TOKEN` - the REST API Access Token 
See: https://github.com/dwyl/gogs-server#connect-via-rest-api-https

3. `GOGS_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` - absolute path to the `id_rsa` file
  on your `localhost` or `Phoenix` server instance.

> @SIMON: this last env var currently not being picked up.
> So it will just use `~/simon/id_rsa` 
> You will need to add your `public` key 
> to the Gogs instance for this to work on your `localhost`
> see:
> https://github.com/dwyl/gogs-server#add-ssh-key


### _Optional_ Environment Variables

#### `GOGS_SSH_PORT`

If your **`Gogs` Server** is configured 
with a **_non-standard_ SSH port**, 
then you need to define it:
`GOGS_SSH_PORT` <br />
e.g: `10022` for our 
`Gogs` Server deployed to Fly.io

You can easily discover the port by either visiting your
Gogs Server Config page: <br />
`https://your-gogs-server.net/admin/config`

e.g:
https://gogs-server.fly.dev/admin/config

![gogs-ssh-port-config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/167105374-ef36752f-80a7-4a77-8c78-2dda44a132f9.png)


Or if you don't have admin access to the config page,
simply view the `ssh` clone link on a repo page,
e.g: https://gogs-server.fly.dev/nelsonic/public-repo

![gogs-ssh-port-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/167104890-31b06fa0-bd23-4ecb-b680-91c92398b0a7.png)

In our case the `GOGS_SSH_PORT` e.g: `10022`. <br />
If you don't set it, then `gogs` will assume TCP port **`22`**.

#### `GIT_TEMP_DIR_PATH`

If you want to specify a directory where 
you want to clone `git` repos to,
create a `GIT_TEMP_DIR_PATH` environment variable.
e.g:

```sh
export GIT_TEMP_DIR_PATH=tmp
```

> **Note**: the directory **must _already_ exist**.
> (it won't be created if it's not there ...)

<br />

## Usage

Here's basic usage example:

### 1. Create Repo

```elixir
# Define the params for the remote repository:
org_name = "myorg"
repo_name = "pepsico-contract1234"
private = false # boolean
# Create the repo!
Gogs.remote_repo_create(org_name, repo_name, private)
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: there is currently no way 
> to create an Organisation on the `Gogs` Server
> via `REST API` so the `org_name` 
> _must_ already exists. 
> e.g: https://gogs-server.fly.dev/myorg
> We will be figuring out a workaround shortly ...
> https://github.com/dwyl/gogs/issues/17


### 2. Clone Repo

```elixir
git_repo_url = GogsHelpers.remote_url_ssh(org_name, repo_name)
Gogs.clone(git_repo_url)
```

### 3. Read Contents of File

TODO: https://github.com/dwyl/gogs/issues/21



### 3. Write to File



### 4. Commit Changes

### 5. Push to `Gogs` Remote

Use it with caution!

That being said,
we are using this package in "production".
It works for _us_ an we _maintain_ it.
If you want to use it, go for it!
But we cannot "support" your usage
beyond answering questions on GitHub.

If you spot anything that can be improved,
